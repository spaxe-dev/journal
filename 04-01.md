# Daily Journal: January 4, 2026

## 🎯 Daily Goals Checklist

- [ ] **Deep Work:** Complete at least one focused session (60–90 mins). ✅
- [ ] **Learn & Build:** If I learned something new, did I build or apply one small thing?.✅ 
- [ ] **Math:** Complete 1 hour of math practice. ✅

## 📝 Outcome:

> Today was unexpectedly huge. I started working on the previous smart sorter project that turned into my first fully built CLI tool. I went from sorting files by extension to designing a clean architecture with a proper command-line interface, JSON-based configuration, dry-run support, and virtual environments.

> I struggled a lot with globals, scope, and how to properly pass data through functions, but instead of copying solutions, I slowed down and reasoned through every error using tracebacks. Turning code completion off helped me think clearly instead of guessing ig. I would have been lot more stuck if I didnt.

### What did I do/understand better today?
> I understood how data should flow through a program without relying on global variables.
> I learned how to properly separate CLI logic from core application logic using Click.
> I got comfortable reading and debugging Python tracebacks instead of fearing them.
> I progressed on differential equations.

### What did I create / attempt?
> I implemented dry-run mode, safe directory creation, and clean argument passing throughout the codebase, I also added CLI inferface!!!

### Was today net positive?
**Verdict:** Yes!

**Why?**
> This was the first time I felt like I truly built something instead of just writing code.
