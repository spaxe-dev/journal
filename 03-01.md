## 📝 Outcome:

> I started off my day with maths as its one of the subjects i struggle with. Spent about 2 hours doing so, with 5 mins break every 30 minutes (pomodoro much). Once that was done I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sItRLFjbqvo) which made me want to start my own little project. Thought it would be nice to do so after not doing one for a long time and refresh myself on filehandling and such in python. Lastly, I have this book ["Courage to be Disliked"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=courage+to+be+disliked) which I wanted to read but always found an excuse not to. So I finally started so, safe to say its quite intresting.

### What did I do/understand better today?
> I worked on differential equations today to deepen my understanding of the subject.
> I understood filehandling in python better today
> I read "Courage to be disliked"

### What did I create / attempt?
> I started a new project, `smart-file-sorter` (https://github.com/spaxe-dev/smart-file-storage), as I felt it had been too long since I started one. I also plan to start learning Russian tomorrow (10-15 mins/day).

### Was today net positive?
**Verdict:** Yes!

**Why?**
> It was a solid day; I got some math done and finally started a new project.
